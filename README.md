## Thunes Transfer Web App

### Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

And UI was built by [Ant-design](https://ant.design/).

This project needs a [service](https://github.com/fghpdf/thunes_sample).

It's the first time I used React. So it is not best practice.

## Install

This project need Node and Yarn.
Then, run `yarn install`

## Start

`yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Link to `/registerSender` then go into transfer flow.

## Build

just `yarn build`.

This command will generate some static files in `build/`

Now app is ready to be deployed.

## What's next

Duo to time limited and unfamiliar with React.

So I did not organize the project very well.

In the future, I will:
- [ ] organize components and get a wonderful level.
- [ ] unit test.
- [ ] CI/CD.
- [ ] repeated code to public code.
- [ ] deploy by Docker.

and so on.
